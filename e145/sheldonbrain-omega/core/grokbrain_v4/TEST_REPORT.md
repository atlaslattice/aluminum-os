## Errors Found & Fixed

### Error 1: Loop Mitigation Decorator Bug
**Location:** `grokbrain_v4.py:74-97`

**Issue:**
```python
TypeError: quarantine_filter() got an unexpected keyword argument 'depth'
```

**Root Cause:**
The `mitigate_loops` decorator was passing `depth` and `start_time` parameters to wrapped functions that don't accept them.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed decorator to use internal `_depth` and `_start_time` parameters that are NOT passed to the wrapped function:

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
def wrapper(*args, depth=0, start_time=None, **kwargs):
    return func(*args, depth=depth+1, start_time=start_time, **kwargs)

# AFTER (fixed):
def wrapper(*args, _depth=0, _start_time=None, **kwargs):
    return func(*args, **kwargs)  # Don't pass _depth/_start_time
```

**Verification:**
✅ Pipeline ran successfully after fix
✅ All tests passed

### Error 2: Test Suite Sample File Detection
**Location:** `test_suite.py:414-415`

**Issue:**
Test 7 failed because it only checked `./exports/` but sample files were moved to `./clean_exports/` after quarantine filtering.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated test to check both directories:
```python
if sample_dir.exists():
    sample_files.extend(list(sample_dir.glob('sample_*.json')))
if clean_dir.exists():
    sample_files.extend(list(clean_dir.glob('sample_*.json')))
```

**Verification:**
✅ Test 7 now passes (found 4/4 sample files)
